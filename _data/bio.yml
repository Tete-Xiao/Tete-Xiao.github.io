  content:  "I'm a Ph.D. student in the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (<strong>BAIR</strong>) Lab at <strong>University of California, Berkeley</strong>, (temporarily) advised by <a href='https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/'>Prof. Trevor Darrell</a> and <a href='https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/'>Prof. Alexei Efros</a>. My research interests lie in the field of <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Robotics</strong>, particularly in enabling intelligent agents perceive, comprehend and reason as we humans do, as well as in understanding how intelligence truly emerges w/o supervision. I graduated from <strong>Peking University (PKU)</strong> in 2019, the most progressive university in China, summa cum laude with a Bachelor's degree. I received China National Scholarship in 2016 and was selected as a <a href='https://snapresearchfs.splashthat.com/'>2019 Snap Research Scholar</a> for my research and school courses. [ <a href='/pdf/resume.pdf'><strong>Résumé</strong></a> ]<br> <br> I interned at MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab as Research Intern based in Cambridge, MA in the year of 2018, during which I fell in love with the great city of Boston. Prior to that I was a senior research intern at Megvii (Face++) Inc. (a leading Chinese AI start-up) for two and a half years mentored by <a href='https://yuningjiang.github.io/'>Mr. Yuning Jiang</a> and supervised by <a href='http://www.jiansun.org/'>Dr. Jian Sun</a>. I was also a research assistant at Institute of Computer Science and Technology (ICST), Peking University, supervised by <a href='http://www.muyadong.com/'>Dr. Yadong Mu</a>. <br> <br> I started computer programming in primary school and have been participating in programming contest involving complicated algorithms and data structures since high school. I was admitted to 2014 Shandong Province Team as the first-place winner to compete in National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI), where I won a bronze medal. Later in college I won two gold medals in 2016 and 2017 <a href='https://icpc.baylor.edu/'>ACM-ICPC</a> Asia Regional Contest for PKU. <br> <br> I have a great fondness for arts besides my academia work. I'm deeply passionate about musical works, especially those in classical music (both instrumental & vocal) and jazz. I'm also into literatures and visual arts. I travel constantly each year, mostly alone in the U.S. and European countries. My most wonderful journey so far was travelling from Berlin to Leipzig, Eisenach, Dresden, Bayreuth and Heidelberg following the trace of some great composers such as J.S. Bach, Felix Mendelssohn, Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. The journey ended up in Paris, the city of art (and love), where writers like Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald have lived their lives. <br> <br> I'm a political activist in both U.S. and my home country. <h2>News:</h2>
