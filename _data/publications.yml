  desc: 'Mini-batch size, a key factor in the training, has not been well studied in previous works on object detection. In this paper, we propose a Large Mini-Batch Object Detector (MegDet) to enable the training with much larger mini-batch size than previous work (i.e., from 16 to 256), so that we are able to effectively utilize multiple GPUs (up to 128 in our experiments) to significantly accelerate training procedure. Our detector is trained in much shorter time yet achieves better accuracy. The MegDet is the backbone of our submission (mmAP 52.5%) to COCO 2017 Challenge, where we won the 1st place of Detection task.'

  desc: 'Detecting individual pedestrians in a crowd remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we explore how a state-of-the-art pedestrian detector is harmed by crowd occlusion and propose a novel crowd-robust regression loss specifically designed for crowd scenes. This loss is driven by two motivations: the attraction by target, and the repulsion by other surrounding objects. Our detector trained by repulsion loss outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods with a significant improvement in occlusion cases.'

  desc: 'Aggregating extra features has been considered as an effective approach to boost traditional pedestrian detection methods. The first contribution of this paper is exploring this in CNN-based pedestrian detection frameworks by evaluating the effects of different kinds of extra features quantitatively. Moreover, we propose a novel network architecture to jointly learn pedestrian detection as well as the given extra feature. By multi-task training, HyperLearner is able to utilize the information of given features and improve detection performance without extra inputs in inference.'
