  desc: 'Aggregating extra features has been considered as an effective approach to boost traditional pedestrian detection methods. The first contribution of this paper is exploring this issue by aggregating extra features into CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. We evaluate the effects of different kinds of extra features quantitatively. Moreover, we propose a novel network architecture, namely HyperLearner, to jointly learn pedestrian detection as well as the given extra feature. By multi-task training, HyperLearner is able to utilize the information of given features and improve detection performance without extra inputs in inference.'
