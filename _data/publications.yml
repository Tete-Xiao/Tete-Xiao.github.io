  desc: 'Human visual perception is not a standalone function at one level of recognition: we understand visual scenes effortlessly at multiple levels, from recognizing the scene category to the objects with, and from identifying the textures of objects to their different compositional parts. In this work, we study a new task called Unified Perceptual Parsing, which requires the vision systems to recognize as many visual concepts as possible from a given image. A new multi-task framework called UPerNet and a training strategy are developed to learn from heterogeneous image annotations. We benchmark our framework on the task of the Unified Perceptual Parsing and show that it is able to effectively segment a wide range of concepts from the given image. We further apply the trained networks to discover the visual knowledge among natural scenes. '

  desc: 'Modern CNN-based object detectors rely on bounding box regression and non-maximum suppression (NMS) to localize objects. While the probabilities for class labels naturally reflect classification confidence, localization confidence is absent. This makes properly localized bounding boxes degenerate during iterative regression or even suppressed during NMS. We propose IoU-Net learning to predict the IoU between each detected bounding box and the matched ground-truth. The network acquires this confidence of localization, which improves NMS procedure by preserving accurately localized bounding boxes. Furthermore, formulating the predicted IoU as an optimization objective provides monotonic improvement in bounding box localization. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO dataset show the advance of IoU-Net and its compatibility and adaptivity to several state-of-the-art object detectors.'

  desc: 'We study the problem of grounding distributional representations of texts on the visual domain, namely visual-semantic embeddings (VSE for short). Begin with an insightful adversarial attack on VSE embeddings, we show the limitation of current frameworks and image-text datasets (e.g., MS-COCO). We show that the model is restricted to establish the link between textual semantics and visual concepts. We alleviate this problem by augmenting the MS-COCO image captioning datasets with synthesized textual contrastive adversarial samples. The samples enforce the model to ground learned embeddings to concrete concepts within the image. This simple but powerful technique brings a noticeable improvement over the baselines on a diverse set of downstream tasks, in addition to defending known-type adversarial attacks.'

  desc: 'Mini-batch size, a key factor in the training, has not been well studied in previous works on object detection. In this paper, we propose a Large Mini-Batch Object Detector (MegDet) to enable the training with much larger mini-batch size than previous work (i.e., from 16 to 256), so that we are able to effectively utilize multiple GPUs (up to 128 in our experiments) to significantly accelerate training procedure. Our detector is trained in much shorter time yet achieves better accuracy. The MegDet is the backbone of our submission (mmAP 52.5%) to COCO 2017 Challenge, where we won the 1st place of Detection task.'

  desc: 'Detecting individual pedestrians in a crowd remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we explore how a state-of-the-art pedestrian detector is harmed by crowd occlusion and propose a novel crowd-robust regression loss specifically designed for crowd scenes. This loss is driven by two motivations: the attraction by target, and the repulsion by other surrounding objects. Our detector trained by repulsion loss outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods with a significant improvement in occlusion cases.'

  desc: 'Aggregating extra features has been considered as an effective approach to boost traditional pedestrian detection methods. The first contribution of this paper is exploring this in CNN-based pedestrian detection frameworks by evaluating the effects of different kinds of extra features quantitatively. Moreover, we propose a novel network architecture to jointly learn pedestrian detection as well as the given extra feature. By multi-task training, HyperLearner is able to utilize the information of given features and improve detection performance without extra inputs in inference.'
