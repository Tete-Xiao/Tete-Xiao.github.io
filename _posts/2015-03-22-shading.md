### Shading in Computer Graphics
{: .text-center}

* Shading of flat polygons
  * Flat shading
    * compute illumination once per polygon and apply it to whole polygon or take color of first vertex
  * Gouraud shading
    * compute illumination at boundary and interpolate over the interior
  * Accurate shading
    * compute illumination at every point of the polygon
* Flat shading
  * Intensity discontinuity across edge
  * If there are very large number of very small polygons, the faceting effects is not obvious
* __Gouraud shading__
  * Interpolative
    * Given colors of the polygn vertices, interior points are colored through bilinear interpolation
  * Vertex normals vs. Face Normals
    * Use the actual surface's normal at each vertex, when the surface is not analytically defined, take the average normal of all neighboring faces

  * Advantages
    * __"Color computation only at vertices"__
      * illumination mode evaluation at vertex shader
      * Simple interpolation at fragment shader
    * Fast and easy
  * Disadvantages
    * __"Color computation only at vertices"__
    * Does not simulate the
* __Phong Shading__
  * Basic idea
    * Interpolate surface normals
    * Compute color at each pixel from interpolated normals
    * Illumination model used at Fragment Shader
* Further Problem No.1 - Polygonal silhouette
  * Subdivide further
    * Refinement only near silhouette
* Further Problem No.2 - Orientation dependence
  * Note first that bilinear interpolation is done along horizontal scanlines
  * When orientation of the same polygon changes, the same point p may be colored differently
  * Solved by triangulate
* Further Problem No.3 - Unrepresentative normal
  * Solved by subdivide surface
